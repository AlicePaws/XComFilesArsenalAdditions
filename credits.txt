I've incorporated the following two submods into XCFAA and patched them accordingly:

Early Game Weapon Overhaul by Eddie

Tactical Lightning for OpenXcom by 60mm

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some sounds from the X-Com X-Files Resound Mod by Ksenni
https://openxcom.org/forum/index.php/topic,8870.0.html

I don't own any of these and should the authors wish them to be removed I will comply with their wishes

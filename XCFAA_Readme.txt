CHANGELOG:
0.3 
Public release
0.31 
Fixed Beretta 93 R's UFOpedia's description
Adjusted new Flare Gun's sprite
Added Tear gas grenades
Disabled Bloodclotter grenade as it doesnt do anything
Added floorobs for the flare gun might need to add more
0.32
Added Canister Shell for HWP
Adjusted new Tracite Flare Ammo sprite
Added "MIB" Laser Weapon expansion:
Laser Machine Pistol
Laser Cannon (AOE)
Both their regular and their "WV" clips
Added "WV" clips for the other laser weapons, these are a different wavelength of laser being fired meant to shred armor while not being able to pierce it, might cause burning damage and hit a bit harder but consume more power (about 50% less ammo) feel free to suggest changes balance it out
Need some help finding out missing audio files and whatnot
0.33
- Added requierements for items so they can be integrated into the campaign:
Riot Gear and Riot Gear Acquisition (Requieres Promotion 1) (Unlocks Teargas Shells and Grenades)
Beretta 93 R Acquisition (Requieres NonStandard Weapons)
Tracite (Requieres Alien Fuel Trace) (Unlocks Alloy Flare Gun)
HWP Cannon Canister Shells (Requieres HWP Cannon)
Exotic Ammo (Requieres Promotion 2) (Unlocks Frag-12 Auto-Shotgun Drums)
"MIB" Lasers are pending!
0.34
- Made the Frag-12 ammunition a single pellet (No more 12 explosive pellets going off lol)
- Migrated the extraSprites/extraSounds to a seperate .rul file
- Adjusted AN-94 so the snap shot is two accurate shots (forgot to add this change in the previous version)
- BlackOps Smart Autoshotgun is in the game (More accurate, can also use baton rounds and some other exotic ammo, need to figure out how to make enemies use it)
- Shard Shotgun is in the game (Shoots out razor sharp alloy blades, Tracite rounds have some fire properties)
- MIB Base missions now have soldiers carrying BlackOps Smart Auto-Shotguns and Auto-Shotguns with Explosive Ammo
- Fixed Frag-12 Round explosion animation and sound
0.35
- Added Smart Auto-Shotgun research to Supersoldier and Security Captain interrogations
- Updated some of the weapon descriptions
- Shard Shotgun:
is semi-campaign ready (Balancing still needed, can be manufactured now) works in space, tracite rounds however will not
Added fire and hit sounds
Rebalanced Clip size, pellet amount and stats

- Added Dragon's breath for Black Ops Auto-Shotgun
- Fixed Frag-12 Drum's explosion sprite
- Added HWP Canister Shot's sprite
- Added Extra pages for the Auto-Shotgun and Smart Auto-Shotgun Ufopedia Articles so you can see the extra ammo
0.36
- Armored Car sprites adjusted to work for the new LWP (light weapon platforms or medium,  not sure of the name yet)
- Utilizing XPiratez version of the green tanks for the sprites!
- Light Weapon Platforms technology introduced which unlocks Light Tanks
- Prioritizing the integration of all these before adding new things 
- Added LWP machine guns
- Doubled the damage the Frag-12 ammo does to terrain but reduced its damage from 45 to 35
- SAFE breaching charge? high terrain damge low damage (sprite done)
- Future Upgrades of the LWP can use camo technology to remain relevant 


- LWP or Light Weapon Platforms, lighter tanks meant to be used for scouting and mobility while retaining some armor and offensive capabilities, they use the spriteset from the XPiratez armored cars, so far there's:
 1) Light Cannon and a Smoke Dispenser
 2) Single barrel Machine Gun with a Smoke Dispenser
 3) Twin barrel Machine Gun with a Smoke Dispenser
- Smoke Dispenser for HWP's and LWP's
- New pictures for the new techs you unlock! uploaded some of them to the mod preview section

Using sounds from the Resound mod for the new Howitzer!

0.36b Fixes 
- Alloy flare gun cannot be bought anymore I forgot to delete the buy price lol
- Beretta 93 R Acquisition has been adjusted and article no longer visible from start 
- AN-94, Smoke Projectors, Heavy Laser Cannon and Laser Machine Pistol, Shard Shotgun, Tear Gas Grenade and the WV Clips for laser have had their UFOpaedia articles locked until you unlock them 
- Light Hand Cannon was already in the mod but I forgot to mention it as well

0.37a
- Reduced  LWP Cannon's Clip size to 28
- Changed the sprite for Tear Gas Mortar Shell
- Buffed Tear Gas Grenades and Mortar Shells stats and changed its damage to Chemical
- Added Riot Vest with optional Shield ...but with a catch... the spritesheet is kind of broken, I cannot find a way to fix it right now so you can either enable it or leave it disabled... in order to enable it move riotVestAdditions.rul from the DISABLED folder into the main folder where the other .rul files are
- Added Heavy Riot Armor (this one works fine I promise :) ) this one is meant to be baby's first tactical suit , the shield on the vest has a slightly very slightly cheaper melee
- Shard Shotgun has been changed from cutting to kinetic damage but ignores a bit of armor now
- Smart Auto-Shotgun has had its stats adjusted, the one hit the hardest was the baton shot, I might actually remove it since I can't figure how to make it so it cannot auto at the very least, overall nerf, even the clipsize got slightly downsized from 20 to 18

Known bugs: Tear Gas mortar isn't working for some reason

0.37b
- Set correct CustomArmorPreviews for Riot Armors and LWP's, I can't for the life of me make a custom one I keep getting weird outlines :(, will sort that later
- Teargas Mortar Shell is now back, along with its revised stats and damage changed to chemical 

0.37c
- Plasma Gatler (plasma minigun, I would love to give this to a muton , currently not a unique weapon meaning it is reproduceable and its temporarily available to manufacture without the item until I give it to an alien)
- Added the extra page to the Mortar and Auto-Mortar's UFOPaedia entries so the Teargas Mortar shows up (0.37b, forgot to mention it)

Known bugs: Wrecks from the new tanks are still pending so don't go wrecking them just yet

0.37d
- Beretta Big Clip locked behind acquisition and price reduced and adjusted listorders, Beretta 93 R price reduced 
- Fixed Tracite Rounds for the new Flare Gun are no longer purchasable
- TODO: Fix Light hand cannon and Light cannon ammo shenanigans and list orders! Buckshot appears to be doubled or missing
- General Listorder fix 
- AN-94 price reduction, list order fixed and overall buff, need more testing 
- Tear Gas Grenade price reduction 
- BlackOps Smart Auto-Shotgun's price raised, ammo prices adjusted as well as its list orders 

0.38
I'm changing my sprite creation pipeline now after help from a lot of people on the forum and discord channel, it's actually very enjoyable now and I'm super thankful for the tips and pointers, I can already see my sprites looking better!
- MR 73 Revolver added, a bit less powerful than the magnum with slightly less armor effectiveness but easier to shoot, more accurate and more range
- MR 73S Revolver Added, like the MR 73 but scoped and a longer barrel, heavier and harder to handle but has impressive range and two handed, balancing needed for these two (The sprite position needs some adjusting, I'm aware of this!)
- BlackOps Revolver and Precision Revolver added (essentially BlackOps versions of the MR 73 and MR 73S, balancing needed ! )
- Updated the AN-94 sprite using the proper spriting method
- Updated LWP/Vehicle Machine Gun's Ammo sprite

0.38a
- Fixed Beretta 93 R's missing firesound and updated the sprite

0.38b
- Riot Vest finally fixed and re-enabled, shoutout to TaoPro, The Martian and krautbernd for helping me out!, I even added the Hybrid versions even if it won't make that much sense to have them at this point
- Riot Vest's helmet sprites fixed for their wide versions
- Description added to both Riot Vest and Riot Heavy Armor 

0.38c
- Restructuring of the whole mod's parts into their respective categories, should be easier to navigate

0.38d
- MR 73 Scoped and Black Ops Precision Revolver's range dropoff lowered from 3 to 2
- Removed Resources.rul (forgot this one, whoops)
- CustomArmorPreviews are back! Riot Vest and Heavy Riot armor get one (don't have one for hybrids YET they use the same version for now, sorry!)
- LWP CustomArmorPreview (just one for now)
- Adjusted LWP Damage Resistance values (they're exactly like HWP's for now) and added LWP's descriptions 
- Adjusted LWP's description that references the Rocket Launcher, it's not done yet so I removed the description for now 

0.39 Shock in the dark
- CustomArmorPreviews for all new armors, Riot Vests as well as their shielded versions
- Introduced a use for Muckstars and their corpses as well as a technology to harness their biology
- Added 2 camouflage (day and night) to LWP's as well as a Night version unlockable later on that has more camo at night but more visible at day 
- Added Heat vision buff to LWP's, and slightly more than that to the non-night versions since they actually use smoke projectors
- Jumpsuit (Night camouflage) A jumpsuit with excellent camo at night, but suffers at day
- Tactical Operation Suit (spritework entirely by the legendary TaoPro! and a huge inspiration for the whole theme of half this expansion) an upgrade to the jumpsuits with more armor while retaining the mobility and camouflage while adding night vision capabilities, excellent for scouting operations
- Cyber Taser and Muckstar Cannon available as taser upgrade paths
- Vehicle modifications! LWP's for now (Plating, available for Cannon, Machinegun and Twin machine gun as well as the Riot Taser) these work by essentially by two manufacturing processes (1 for plating 1 for unplating, fully reimbursed materials, but not money)
- Night Camouflage for your LWP's ! (For Cannon, Machinegun and Twin Machinegun)
- Riot LWP's ! (A model with a Launcher that shoots either Teargas or Rubber bullets, as well as a Riot Taser model)
- Vehicle Flare Projectors: Like a flare gun for your vehicles but a lot less demoralization and burning and more for utility, these come with your Night models
- Proximity Flares: throw them and they'll light up when anything comes close to them
- Adjusted the LWP's stats slightly to define their roles:
 Hunter LWP (Regular) some heat vision, tiny bit of camouflage, regular armor (These upgrade into vehicles with sensors later on capable of more, NOT IMPLEMENTED THEY'RE JUST REGULAR FOR NOW)
 Riot LWP loses some heat vision, tiny bit of camouflage, slightly more armor but less stats to reactions and accuracy
 Night LWP loses some heat vision, some camouflage during night, less camouflage during day, regular armor
 Plated LWP loses some heat vision, loses camouflage, slightly more armor than riot but less stats to the point you get negative -5 accuracy and reactions
Any version that isnt a Hunter usually trades sensors or camouflage for whatever they specialize in
- Fixed Manuhrin Revolver Drum purchase
- Fixed Beretta 93 R's missing floorob
- Fixed Riot Gear Ufopaedia Slide not showing 
- Moved Scoped Manuhrin a bit further by requiering Military Envoy Contact
- Locked Tracite behind Chief Researcher Contact
0.39a Shock in the dark
- Messing with scripting meaning that any new armors will have shields when used by hybrids as usual 
- Implemented a "daze" effect for teargas, it's different in that its milder but it lasts longer
- Teargas resistances set to armors, creatures with exposed airways take regular damage, creatures that dwell underwater or are pure soft tissue closer to our biology get affected a lot more
- Finally set resistances for the newer tanks, night armors have higher flashbang sensibility because of the higher sesnitivity of the sensors at night (more light gets in) while tanks are immune to teargas (yours are at least since its an AI)
- Tear gas weaponry should no longer damage the terrain, it also received a pretty intensive rework
- Tear gas grenades work exactly like flashbangs do when using them, no priming needed and a flat cost to using them
- Tear gas grenades,mortars and launchers have the proper explosion animation now 
- Fixed the Tear gas grenade ufopaedia entry
- Crystal Weave and Pertite Plate coded in! Webwear for Laser and Plasma respectively and heavier than them, not implemented in campaign yet
- Made custom sprites for the Tank Riot Launcher and its ammo as well as proper ufopaedia article
- Made Custom sprites for the Tank Riot Taser Cannon and its batteries as well as ufopaedia article for it
- Fixed Light Hand Cannon ammo's sprites showing up as the Light Cannon ammo ones
- All new Night, Plated and Riot LWP's should have their correct UFOpaedia entries
- Riot Taser and its Plated versions had their stats swapped since they were reversed, they're fine now
0.39b Shock in the dark
- Inspiration from nl2555 for the breaching charges
- Added support for Eddie's Weapon Overhaul AP ammo on the AN-94 Rifle
- Moved muckstar batteries behind the muckstar cannon research
- Moved the Riot Taser Cannon Tank behind Taser Cannon
- Added melee sound for the Riot Shield
- Added missing references for certain head sprites
- Added missing floorob and handob for an-94
Known bugs: Manuhrin bullet sprite is broken for some reason
0.4 Resuscitator and Optional music!
- Moved Exotic Ammunition back to Promotion II
- Moved Manuhrin Revolver back to Promotion I
- Reduced Auto Shotgun's Dragonbreath's morale damaged and increased shotgunSpread value from 25 to 50
- Introduced KS-23M Flashbang and Teargas rounds (I didn't even know this shotgun could fire these)
- Added flechette and flak ammo (alloy version of flechette) to Shotgun and BlackOps shotgun
- Added Tracite fire effect to the Tracite rounds for the Shard Shotgun
- Added Breaching charges, extremely reduced radius but extra damage to terrain, less damage to you but still dangerous to use (Right now only one is available, two more tiers are still in development)
- Changed Shard shotgun's shotgun spread to 50, reduced auto shot to 2 and added an aimed shot, also the tracite infused rounds are now slugs, normalized clipsize from 8 and 6 to 7 for both
- Added PTRD41 and PTRS41 14.5mm anti-tank rifles, can be acquired from both weapon boxes and reinforced weapon boxes (reinforced have a higher chance, plus they might contain HE ammo)
- Added NTW20 Denel 20mm anti-materiel rifle, can be acquired from reinforced weapon boxes, HE ammo is more rare than the AP one
- Fixed Red Dawn Armored Cars showing the ufopaedia page for the LWP's (the stats werent changed, it was just the incorrect article shown)
* Optional: New music for Sewer missions as well as some Cyberweb missions  (tracks from XCOM Apocalypse and They Live)
need some feedback regarding volume, I had to boost the tracks a bit
- I've finally completed my first script, its an alien resuscitator, you prime it and the idea is you either carry it on you so when you fall unconscious and wounded it triggers OR you can throw it near another of your units to activate it it will stabilize your agent's wounds but for every wound you will get a sanity/morale penalty and if you happen to reach critical stabilization (that is, if your wounds exceed your health) then you get a fixed penalty plus the cost to heal the wounds to get you back to non-critical state, it lasts two turns  and during those two turns it will at most heal you once each turn automatically for now I want it to eventually be a sort of turn-limited beacon that refreshes itself when you're near it instead of relying on hitting others
The above alien resuscitator is unreplicable, in the future I will make a replicable version that will instead allow you to "pause" your wounds if your soldier reaches a critical state or simply makes your agents go into "stasis" by pausing the wounds and at the end of the effect it returns the same wounds unless you cured them 
- Using some of the awesome audio from the X-Com X-Files Resound Mod by Ksenni for the new anti-tank/anti-materiel rifles, if you haven't tried it you should give it a go, really adds to the atmosphere
- To acquire some of the new weapons you need to interrogate mid to high ranking members of the cults, right now all 4 cults give you access to all 3 weapons but that might change (PTRD being maybe a Red Dawn only thing and Denel could be Dagon only)
0.41 Support Grenades integration
- Completely reworked the scripts for Support Grenades, should be much cleaner and easier to read
- Introduced support for Support Grenades, so far only Stasis and Resuscitator are in
- Stasis grenade: it pauses your wounds and when the effect expires the wounds come back
- Made Resuscitator and Stasis grenades loot available from osiron boxes but they're extremely rare, they're also non craftable
- Added Quantum Data Slate, like an Alien Data Slate but only contains critical research, extremely rare from osiron boxes and requieres the highest tier lab to decrypt
- Moved Plasma Gatler tech behind Quantum Data Slate
0.4.2(a+b)
- heavy riot suit price from 30k to 40k, Changed transfer time to 14 days and also locked behind durathread
- Added Anti-Tank Infantry commendation for PTRD41, PTRS41 and Denel NTW20 rifle
- Added Anti-Tank Rifles article under the Field Manual section
- Added Explosives Licence dependency to Breaching charge because I literaly forgot the line and it didn't break miraculously
- Fixed some weapons showing up before researching them
- Added Stasis and Resuscitator to possible research unlocks from the Quantum Slate
- Moved LWP behind Tank/Scout research
- Moved Light Tank/Cannon and Light/Tank Machinegun behind Vehicle Smoke Dispenser (might just remove it as a research)
- Added new reload and fire sounds for PTR41 rifles as well as the NTW20 Denel, from the submod X-Com Files Resound
- I'll be adapting the Night Ops suit that was added to the XCF mod so they dont conflict 
- Removed AP ammo from AN94 because it kind of slaps too much, and increased TU cost for snap shot from 25 to 26 (one shot less)
- Reordered bullet sprites and fixed them
- Made explosion sprites fixed after I learned how to make them properly work! now Tracite and Dragonbreath have their own explosion sprites, smoke dispensers and the like should also work now
0.4.2(c+d)
- Fixed PTRS41 Sprite
- Fixed Handobs for most weapons in the submod
- More of the shotgun ammo has floorobs now
- Known bugs: Teargas sometimes still affects tanks
- Fixed PTR and Denel HE clips being incendiary
- Moved AN94 Rifle behind red dawn units and added to Reinforced Weapon Box and regular Weapon Boxes
- Moved all UFOPaedia articles listorders so they make more sense (Alloy Shotgun in shotguns, Manuhrin Revolver near Magnum etc)
- Fixed Anti-Tank rifles Field Manual entry, both image and text 
0.4.2e
- Added entries to everything that was missing
- Added missing .357 Tritanium Drum and Shotgun Flak Shells manufacture projects
- Missing Flechette shell floorob
- Added "All HQ's Located" research, gives 100 points and is one of the prerequisites for the Denel NTW20
- Moved Denel a bit earlier by not requiring Promotion III but increased its price to 35k and instead you must find all 4 HQ's which will unlock one of the research prequisites to use it
- Made PTRD41 appear earlier by only requiring to research it plus Red Dawn operations
- Changed PTRS41 acquisition by making it require finding the Red Dawn HQ
- Fixed visibility at dark not working for tanks 
0.5 The Big Boys
- Added RT20, Model SS41, M3 Carl Gustav, M72 LAW, S18 Solothurn 1000, M42 Carl Gustav Rifle as well as their respective kill criteria inside the commendations
- Model SS41: Utilizes a smaller caliber than usual Anti-Tank rifles and achieves penetration by instead utilizing extreme velocities, more ammo capacity but less power
- RT20: A recoiless rifle that despite being lighter and smaller than the Denel fires a more powerful round, single shot only
- M72 LAW: A cheap one-use rocket launcher meant as a lighter and smaller alternative to the RPG
- M3 Carl Gustav: A versatile weapon that can function as both anti vehicle and anti personel roles depending on the ammo used, can also use Star Rounds (Flare)
- M42 Carl Gustav Rifle: Single shot recoiless rifle, massive round with obscene penetration
- S18 Solothurn 1000: A very expensive upgrade to your semi auto anti tank rifles, above average accuracy compared to the rest as well
- Spread all items across the 4 cults, except Solothurn and M42 Gustav, they require a bit more than that since they're in the highest tier
- Mostly integrated with Ammo, Weapon and Reinforced Weapon Boxes, still missing a few more things here and there
- Added Mortar Star Shell (Flare)
- Added functional exclusively illuminating ammo for the Flare Guns
- Added BlackOps Smart Launcher: Fires Regular HE, Proximity rounds I would love to add a primed timed fuse grenade eventually to this
- Added hit effects for the HWP Canister Shot 

0.5.1
- Silenced some debug_logs 
- Buffed Anti-Tank Rifle damage (uses the same formula as barett now, except the HE ammo which uses 0.2)
- Added M82 Barett HE Clip
- Buffed SS41 to be able to shoot two snap shots 

- Shard Shotgun can now inflict bleeding status (temporary lethal wounds or damage over time that eventually stops, but any additional or previous wounds are unchanged)
Known bugs: taking a LWP Cannon to a Jarhead Factory and aborting crashes the game for some reason 
0.5.2
- Fixed fatal error having to do with commendations, unsure what exactly causes it but I am copying the entire Rocket Launcher commendation just so I can add the Gustav and Law to them

- Added Cyber Taser and Muckstar Overvolted Clip which deals AOE and increased damage but with a higher chance to kill the target, these require both Cyber Taser and Muckstar Cannon projects researched before they can be manufactured
- Alloy Flare gun and Tracite ammo is more expensive to make, but Tracite now only takes 1 alien fuel trace to manufacture (cost is doubled)
0.5.6
- Added Accurized versions of the Shotgun and BlackOps shotgun, they sacrifice snap shot accuracy and TU costs for extra range and aimed shot accuracy plus they have a tighter shotgun choke, their dropoff is 4 rather than 6 as well
0.5.7
- Stocks and Bipods have been implemented as reversible manufacturing projects, stocks focus on making automatic fire easier to handle but increasing the weight and size, while bipods will halve (approximately) your overall accuracy while not kneeling but provide a slight TU cost as well as a range increase, your accuracy stats are slightly better than the original when kneeling (after the 200% bonus 10 to 20% increase)

Known bugs: vanilla XCF Taser Cannon floorob is gone?
0.7.0
- Fixed some missing strings/strings with wrong names
- Added Commendations for all the new weapons XCFA added, a few (one or two) are actually hybrid class so they benefit from 2 commendation classes rather than one as well!
- Added Cult Surveys as well as the rest of the missing Weapon Boxes for each cult:
Exactly like Land Surveys but for cults, needs some further balancing, each cult's survey is unlocked after interrogating their respective  vanilla "logistics" unit (Sailor, Witch, Chosen etc)
- Added Sturmpistole (Attachments: Stock):
Modified flare pistol that can fire some grenade rounds, HE, INC and Smoke rounds available plus the flare gun's ammo
- Added Mini Mortar:

Compact MP5 that uses a smaller magazine than its bigger counterpart
- Added HK51:
MP5 sized FN FAL
- Added LWP Autocannon:
Unlocked later on, a cannon focused on delivering more firepower at the expense of some accuracy and range, will make your tanks more expensive and there's no modular form for it so think carefuly about using it, it cannot use the Canister shot either
- Added LWP Cannon Canister and AP  shot (canister is for Cannon only for now)
Canister shot works just the same as the one on the HWP, and the AP are non AOE shells, useful if you want to avoid friendly fire and focus on armored targets

Baby's first OICW
- Added AP ammo for the OICW
- Added Riot Stab Vest:
A vest designed to protect against bladed weapons up close
- Added M16MK:
Underbarrel shotgun attachment

Multipurpose rifle with limited magazine capacity
- Added B-52 Stratofortress:
Serves as a craft between the dragonfly and the first skyranger in terms of transport ability, multi-role, can equip heavy cannons, howitzers, heavy plating or heavy fuel tanks, VERY expensive and cannot hunt down UFO's with its speed, lastly you can unlock higher cargo capacities while sacrificing fuel economy and the ability to equip heavy plating
- Added Motorbike:
Single person vehicle, for those playthroughs where you want to send out lone agents against the world, faster than the sports car
- Added nameAsAmmo properties to the following weapon's ammo:
 BlackOps Auto-Shotgun exotic ammo

 Flare Pistol ammo
 LWP Riot Launcher ammo
 Light Hand Cannon ammo
 KS-23M exotic ammo

Added Scoped Magnum into Illegal Requisition Files
Accurized Shotgun locked behind Promotion I

LWP Machine Gun and Cannon ammo has increased clip size
Beretta 93R non auto modes slightly nerfed

Several buckshot and pellet-like ammo now have 50% damage to stun and time

Tritanium buckshot has more range than regular buckshot before the damage reduction kicks in
Flechette travels for longer than buckshot before losing damage, has much less stopping power but can pierce armor (only 10% Tu damage)
Flak travels even further than flechettes, tritanium version of Flechettes
Dragonbreath has the same range as buckshot but damage dropoff is twice as much, suffers from 15% less armor penetration but can cause morale damage and set things on fire (only 10% Tu damage)

Anti-Tank rifles accuracy has been halved (Kneel bonus is 2x accuracy, forgot to adjust accuracy for that) their range diminished slightly and snapRange reigned down so you can't overwatch as easily but the formula for aiming has been changed to use both strenght and firing acccuracy
Additionally the accuracy formula is now the same for all the AT Rifles, the bonus damage from firing accuracy has also been roughly set to be the same, the difference should come from the power and type of the catridge itself

Cannon unlocks Autocannon and Twin Machinegun

Added missing LWP Riot Launcher ammo manufacture projects
Fixed hit sound for M3 Carl Gustav's Flechette round
Silenced more debug_log lines
Added script for working wieldable shields! They provide two stats: extra Armor in damage calculations and durability

0.8.1c
*Scripting:
Fixed shields not properly taking damage resistances that werent kinetic or incendiary, they will now properly attenuate damage and receive the proper damage as well as also have their durability reduced by the affected damage.
- Old shields when hit with 50 kinetic if they had 20 armor would properly send the damage to be calculated against your soldier as 30 but would reduce their durability by the full 50
- Old shields when hit with 100 plasma  if they had 20 armor would check damage type and if there were no plasma damage reductions it'd treat it as 0 therefore nullifying the damage
- New shields when hit with 50 kinetic still send the 30 damage to your soldiers armor but will now properly take off 30 durability instead of 50
- New shields when hit with 100 plasma if they had 20 armor will now check damage resistance, default to 100 if none is found and will continue the normal path of damage instead of nullifying it 
Shields had their armor values slightly buffed:
- 10 for Riot (was 8)
- 12 for Combat (was 10)
- 14 for Alloy (was 12)
- 20 for Assault (was 15)
- 18 for Stormtrooper (was 15)
